# Ruby Mini Project: Flashcards

In this project, you'll write a flascard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. 

In order to build good habits, we've broken the project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As you work through each iteration, use TDD to drive out the desired behavior. 

The rubric for this project is included at the bottom of this file.
